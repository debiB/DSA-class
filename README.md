# Union-Find, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort Implementations in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of three fundamental algorithms: Union-Find, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. 



## Union-Find

The Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure is a critical component for solving various graph-related problems, like cycle detection in graphs. This repository includes a Python implementation of the Union-Find data structure.

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a popular divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm known for its stability and efficiency. Here, you can find a Python implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm.

## Quick Sort

Quick Sort is another efficient sorting algorithm that utilizes the divide-and-conquer approach. You'll discover a Python implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in this repository.
